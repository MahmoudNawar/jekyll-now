### RECENT REPORTED SECURITY VULNERABILITIES

-   Portal of a confidential university [unsolved till now].

    -   Severe security issue that would allow attackers to retrieve and
        edit the confidential details (enrollment info, national id,
        address, phone number, etc) of all graduate students.

-   E-learning system of a confidential university [unsolved till now].

    -   Security issue that would allow attackers to impersonate any new
        student that didn't reset his default password.
